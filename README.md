# ssv_carpooling

Dart & Flutter app built during the Hackaburg 2019. I've tried using Google Maps API for the first time, using official Maps library for Flutter.

App was built in a few hours, and it's just a static application with most of it's widgets hardcoded. 
I keep it here for my own reference.

Feel free to use some of the custom widgets.
